      Okay let's talk a little bit about relative font sizing. And for that
      we're going to take a look at font size before that HTML. And it's located
      in the same folder as the previous file. Now there are two units of
      measurements that are relative that we're going to talk about and that is
      percent and ems. Let's start with percent first of all let's specify that
      our body tag should have fun size of a 120 %. And what that means is Is
      that we want to take whatever the default size is, and by default I mean
      whatever the browser provides by default, and increase it by 120%. You can
      actually do a quick calculation and figure out what pixel size that would
      be. Most browsers have 16 pixels as default text size. So 120% of 16 would
      a little bit over 19 pixels. So if we refresh the page, we'll see that we
      increased the font size in the entire HTML document. Let's now target the
      very first text here that says 2em text. So lets go ahead and actually use
      an inline style since we're just testing and specify the font size to be
      2em. And is a unit of measurement that is equivalent to the width of the
      letter m in this particular font that we're using. It sounds a little bit
      confusing at first, but the bottom line is it's a relative size. It's
      relative to something. And for this div where it says 2em text, what this
      is saying is it's relative to whatever the font size is at the moment
      we're applying it. Since we set the font size to 120% in the entire body,
      this div also received at 120% and when you combine this font size with
      this one, this basically says I want to increase the font two times of
      whatever a 120 was. So if we take a look at this text this 2em should
      really increase twice as large as this word regular text. So if we save
      the file and refresh, and you can see now everything since that div
      includes the other divs they got increased. That looks just about right
      that it's twice the size of the regular text. Now you might find this
      confusing.
